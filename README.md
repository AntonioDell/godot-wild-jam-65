## Hints/Known issues
You can jump while charging and then release the charge to get extra height/width on difficult jumps.

Getting into the movement controls is hard. Sadly we don't have the time for refinement before the submission deadline. We'll work on it afterwards :)

The movement is a bit easier when playing with a controller. But be aware: Controller support is only given on downloadable builds.
